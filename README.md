# Coursera Convolutional Neural Networks

These are all the notebooks I completed as part of Andrew Ng's CNN course. I also included my lecture notes as well as the notes I took on papers I read as part of this course. Please don't copy the code in the notebooks verbatim, only use it if you are struggling as an aid.
